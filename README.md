# AR & Dispute Management System




hi

## 1. Overview

This project aims to build a web-based **AR & Dispute Management System** to replace manual Excel trackers (like the "Overdue Tracker Data Commentary"). It will serve as a centralized platform for Billers, Collectors, Operations Managers, and Directors to manage, track, and report on overdue Accounts Receivable (AR) invoices and associated disputes.

The system will streamline workflows, improve collaboration, provide real-time visibility into AR health, enforce standardized dispute/status coding, and generate essential management reports (MIS).

## 2. Goals

*   Centralize overdue AR invoice and dispute tracking.
*   Eliminate reliance on shared, manual Excel files.
*   Provide role-based access and views for different user types.
*   Standardize the categorization of disputes, root causes, and outcomes using predefined dropdowns.
*   Enable efficient assignment and tracking of tasks (invoice resolution).
*   Improve visibility through real-time dashboards and reports.
*   Create an audit trail of actions and comments.
*   Facilitate Promise-to-Pay (PTP) tracking.

## 3. User Roles & Access Control

The system will support the following user roles with distinct permissions:

1.  **Biller:** Focuses on invoice-related issues. Can view assigned invoices, update status/codes (Dispute, Root Cause, Outcome, L1/L2/L3), add comments.
2.  **Collector:** Focuses on payment collection and payment-related disputes. Can view assigned invoices, update status/codes, log PTPs, add comments, track contact history.
3.  **Operations (Manager/Lead):** Oversees Billers/Collectors. Can view all invoices (or team-specific), assign/reassign invoices, review work, access detailed reports, potentially manage users/dropdown values.
4.  **Director:** High-level oversight. Needs dashboard views of key metrics and trends, access to summary MIS reports. Typically has read-only access to detailed invoice data.
5.  **(Optional) Administrator:** Manages user accounts, roles, dropdown lists, and system settings.

## 4. Frontend Design Flow & UI Features

### 4.1. Authentication

*   **Login Page:**
    *   Fields: Email/Username, Password.
    *   Actions: Login Button, "Forgot Password?" link.
*   **Forgot Password Flow:** Standard email-based password reset mechanism.
*   **Signup:** (Determine if self-signup or Admin-managed user creation). If self-signup, needs Name, Email, Password fields. Role assignment might be manual by Admin post-signup.

### 4.2. Common UI Elements (Post-Login)

*   **Navigation:** Persistent Sidebar or Top Bar containing links relevant to the user's role (Dashboard, Worklist, Reports, etc.).
*   **User Profile Area:** Displays logged-in user's name, logout button.

### 4.3. Role-Specific Views

**(A) Biller / Collector View:**

*   **Dashboard:** Widgets showing assigned items count, total assigned amount due, aging summary chart, upcoming reminders/PTPs.
*   **My Worklist:**
    *   Data Table: Lists assigned invoices (Invoice #, Customer, Due Date, Age, Amount, Status, PTP Date etc.).
    *   Functionality: Sorting, Filtering, Searching.
    *   Action: Click invoice number to navigate to detail view.
*   **Invoice Detail Page:**
    *   View: Full invoice details.
    *   Edit Area:
        *   **Dropdowns:** Update **L1/L2/L3 Status**, **Dispute Code**, **Root Cause**, **Outcome Status**. *Crucial for standardization.*
        *   **PTP Fields (Collector):** Add/Edit PTP Date & Amount.
        *   **Comments:** Add new comments (text area).
    *   Display Area: Chronological history of comments and actions (audit trail).
    *   Action: "Save Changes" button.

**(B) Operations View:**

*   **Dashboard:** Team/Overall KPIs (Total Open AR, Aging, Dispute counts, Team Performance snippets, Unassigned items queue).
*   **All Invoices / Search Page:**
    *   Data Table: Shows *all* (or team's) invoices, including "Assigned To" column.
    *   Functionality: Advanced Filtering (by assignee, status, codes), Sorting, Searching.
    *   Action: Assign/Reassign invoices (e.g., via button/dropdown on selection). Click invoice number for detail view.
*   **Invoice Detail Page:** Similar view to Biller/Collector, but with added capability to **Assign/Reassign**. May have read-only access unless actively taking ownership or overriding.
*   **Reports Page:** Access to all operational and summary reports, filterable by team/user.

**(C) Director View:**

*   **Dashboard:** High-level aggregated KPIs (Total AR trends, Overall Aging, Top Overdues/Risks, Dispute $ trend). Focus on visuals and summaries.
*   **All Invoices / Search Page:** Read-only access to the same table as Operations.
*   **Invoice Detail Page:** Read-only view of all details, status, and history. No edit capabilities.
*   **Reports Page:**
    *   Access to pre-defined MIS reports (Total Open AR Trend, Aging Report, Top 25 Customers, Dispute Analysis, Performance Summaries).
    *   Functionality: View reports, apply basic filters (e.g., date range), **Export to CSV/Excel**.

## 5. Core Backend Functionality

*   Secure User Authentication & Authorization based on roles.
*   API endpoints for all frontend actions (fetching data, updating status, adding comments, assigning tasks).
*   Data ingestion mechanism (e.g., processing uploaded CSV files or API integration with source system - *define scope*).
*   Business logic for calculating invoice aging.
*   Database storage for AR data, user information, status codes, comments, audit logs.
*   Logic for generating report data based on various criteria.

## 6. Technology Stack (Suggested)

*   **Frontend:** React.js (or Vue.js / Angular)
*   **Backend:** Python with Flask/Django (or Node.js with Express)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (or MySQL)
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS / Azure / GCP
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket)
*   **Containerization:** Docker (Recommended)

## 7. Getting Started (Development Setup - Placeholder)

1.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to backend directory: `cd backend`
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or equivalent)
    *   Configure environment variables (`.env` file): Database connection string, secret key, etc.
    *   Run database migrations: `flask db upgrade` (or equivalent)
    *   (Optional) Seed initial data (e.g., dropdown values, admin user).
3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to frontend directory: `cd frontend`
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
    *   Configure environment variables (`.env` file): API endpoint URL.
4.  **Run Application:**
    *   Start backend server: `flask run` (or equivalent)
    *   Start frontend server: `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
5.  **Access:** Open browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port).

## 8. Next Steps / Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   Direct integration with ERP/Accounting system API.
*   Automated email notifications (e.g., for assignments, PTP reminders).
*   More advanced reporting/analytics.
*   AI features (e.g., predicting payment dates - like HighRadius).
*   Bulk update capabilities.
